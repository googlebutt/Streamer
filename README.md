# Streamer
A lightweight launcher for Livestreamer

Welcome!

Streamer is a simple and lightweight solution for launching Twitch streams using the Livestreamer command-line utility.

Livestreamer allows you to view streams in the media player of your choice (VLC, MPC-HC etc.). These media players (especially MPC-HC) are much less CPU/Mem intensive than in-browser viewing. This is a great solution if you have a low performance machine or are looking to watch streams while you game.

Simply type in the username of your streamer, select the quality and go! Iâ€™ve also included Twitch chat. Streamer will store your last inputs as default. 


You can find Livestreamer here: http://docs.livestreamer.io/


Enjoy.
